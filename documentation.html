		<h2>Overview:</h2>

		This webapp allows a user to view the various plate data transfers among global sites at Photronics. 
		The app refreshes its data every 30 seconds, providing a pseudo-real time view of the transfers.
		The app.jsp file functions as the home page, relying on map.js as the primary source of javascript logic.
		The Java files are called with AJAX from map.js to interact with the Oracle database in the backend.
		The app is intended to run on a Tomcat 6 webserver.
		It was constructed in the Eclipse IDE.

		<h2>How to Build:</h2>
		<p>Built with <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Apache Maven 3.2.2</a></p>
		Build to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAR_(file_format)">war file</a> using the package phase, i.e.
		<br> <span style="font-family: Lucida Console"> > mvn clean package </span>
		<p>All the necessary files for the webapp will be in the resulting war file.</p>

		<h2>How to Deploy:</h2>

		Manually move the war file to your tomcat/webapps folder. <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/deployer-howto.html">See here for additional details</a>.
		<p>You can also perhaps set up the pom.xml so maven can handle automatic deployment.</p>

		<h2>External Libraries:</h2>

		This app relies on a variety of outside code.

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial">Google maps API V3</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/infobox/docs/reference.html">InfoBox</a> - for the numbers next to each marker on the google map</li>
			<li><a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery 1.11.1</a> - DOM manipulation</li>
			<li><a href="http://codemirror.net/index.html">CodeMirror 4.3</a> - provides an in-browser code editor</li>
			<li><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started">Twitter Bootstrap V3</a> - html/css components for look and feel</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/jschr/bootstrap-modal">Bootstrap Modal V2.2.5</a> - extends upon the limited Bootstrap modal</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>About the AJAX Calls:</h2>
		This application relies on using AJAX to refresh the data without having to reload the whole webpage. 
		The AJAX calls use POST and GET requests to Java servlets, which in turn uses SQL queries via JDBC to interact with the Oracle database.
		During the timed interval refresh which occurs every 30 seconds, the map and the double click modal will update.
		However, the other modals such as the "View and Edit XML History" modal will not refresh.
		
		<h2>XML Input Explanation:</h2>
		The app reads from an XML file as the primary source of data.
		Check out demo.xml in the same directory as this document.
		Essentially, it contains a list of sites as senders.
		Each one of these sender sites contains a list of receivers.
		Each one of these receivers contains zero to many plates.
		The plates can contain as much information as necessary.
		Note that the order the sender sites appear in does not matter, and sites can be excluded altogether.

		<h2>Map.js Description:</h2>
		Map.js contains code that serves as the backbone of this application.
		It controls the UI and handles all user interaction. 
		Here is a table with descriptions of the functions (excluding inner and class functions) within the file.
		Note that a "modal" is the UI component that pops up when a marker is double clicked.

		<br>

		<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Function</th>
					<th>Returns</th>
					<th>Description</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>initialize()</td>
					<td>void</td>
					<td>
						This is the first function to be called when the page is loaded. 
						It carries out a few significant tasks in this order:
						<ol>
							<li>Creates the Google map display</li>
							<li>Places down the Google maps markers indicating each Photronics site</li>
							<li>Initializes all event handlers (single/double click on the markers, Toggle All Lines button)</li>
							<li>Creates all AJAX handlers (most importantly the ajaxRefresh function which refreshes the page every 30 seconds with new data)</li>
						</ol>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>populateMarkerModal(smartMarker)</td>
					<td>void</td>
					<td>
						Takes a SmartMarker object whose data is used to fill up the modal display.
						Populates the dbl-click-modal (which pops up when a marker is double clicked) with data.
						First creates the "Sending" portion of the modal and then the "Receiving" portion.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>toggleBlackLines(blackLinesToggle)</td>
					<td>blackLinesToggle - set to the opposite value that was passed in</td>
					<td>
						Takes a boolean blackLinesToggle which dictates whether to turn all lines on or off.
						Populates the dbl-click-modal (which pops up when a marker is double clicked) with data.
						
						First creates the "Sending" portion of the modal and then the "Receiving" portion.
					</td>
				</tr> 
				<tr>
					<td>onPolylines(smartMarker)</td>
					<td>void</td>
					<td>
						Takes a SmartMarker object and turns on all the polylines (the lines on the map which indicate data transfers)
						Populates the dbl-click-modal (which pops up when a marker is double clicked) with data.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>midpoint(coordArr)</td>
					<td>google.maps.LatLng</td>
					<td>
						Takes an array of two LatLng objs and returns a new LatLng midpoint.

		</table>

		<h2>SmartMarker Class Description:</h2>

		SmartMarker is a class in map.js that wraps the google.maps.Marker class to provide additional functionality for this app.
		Extending the Marker class as my own allowed me to handle the display of data in a manageable way.
